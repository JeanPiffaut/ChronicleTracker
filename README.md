## Setting up Project Environment Variables

To configure the necessary environment variables for the project, follow these steps:

1. Locate the `.env.example` file in the project's root directory.
2. Make a copy of this file and rename it to `.env`.
3. Open the `.env` file and fill in the values of the environment variables according to the project's requirements.

It is important to properly configure the environment variables for the project to function correctly. These variables may contain sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, or credentials, so it is recommended not to include them directly in the source code.

## Installing Project Dependencies

To install the required dependencies for the project, use the `requirements.txt` file located in the root directory. Run the following command in the terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file and set up the environment for the project to work correctly.

With these configurations and dependencies installed, you will be ready to start working on the project. Happy coding!
